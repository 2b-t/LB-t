# LB-t - A parallel 3D lattice-Boltzmann CFD solver

Author: [Tobit Flatscher](https://github.com/2b-t)

## Code design

TODO

- Explain abstraction of memory and access patterns
- One and two populations
- Separate static and dynamic interface
- Allow code to be compiled without VTK
- Program all boundary conditions only once for all orientations and lattices
- Program collision operators once for all lattices

Detail architecture with PlantUML
